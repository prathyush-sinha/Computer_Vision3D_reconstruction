# Computer_Vision3D_reconstruction
Objective: 3D modeling of a scene via reconstruction from multi-view stereo images of the scene.

1. Collect as many images as possible (from multiple and all the viewpoints) of the object/scene/landscape/building that you want to model. 
2. Clone the Hierarchial Localisation repository from github.
3. Update the "images" path variable with the path of your image directory.
4. Update the ""outputs"" path variable with the path of the destination where you want your outputs to be saved.
5. Then run the main.ipynb code attached here.

## Feel free to play with different parameters of this code - specially the selection of feature extraction and feature matching tools are the most crucial for optimised performance.
